# Carding Tool üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to **Carding Tool**, a powerful command-line utility designed for carding enthusiasts and security researchers. This tool provides a suite of features to generate credit card numbers, check the validity of cards, and look up BIN (Bank Identification Number) details using a local database. Built with Python, this tool offers a colorful and user-friendly terminal interface, making it easy to use for both beginners and advanced users.

**Note**: This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Misuse of this tool for illegal activities is strictly prohibited. Always comply with local laws and regulations.

## Features üåü

### 1. **Local BIN Checker**
The Local BIN Checker allows you to look up details about a credit card's BIN (first 6 digits of the card number) using a local database (`bin-list-data.csv`). This feature provides detailed information about the card, including:
- **Brand**: The card brand (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express).
- **Type**: The card type (e.g., Credit, Debit, Prepaid).
- **Category**: The card category (e.g., Classic, Gold, Platinum).
- **Issuer**: The issuing bank or financial institution.
- **Issuer Contact**: Phone number and website of the issuer.
- **Country**: The country of issuance, including ISO codes (2-letter and 3-letter) and the country name.
- **Transaction Usability**: Determines if the card is usable for transactions based on the issuer and country (e.g., restricted countries like North Korea are flagged).

#### How It Works:
- The tool loads BIN data from `bin-list-data.csv` on the first run and saves it as a `bin_data.pkl` file for faster loading in future runs.
- You can input BINs manually or load them from a text file (one BIN per line).
- The tool checks each BIN against the database and displays detailed information for valid BINs.

#### Example Output:
```
BIN: 424182
Brand: Visa
Type: Debit
Category: Classic
Prepaid: No
Issuer: Sample Bank
Issuer Phone: 123-456-7890
Issuer URL: http://samplebank.com
Country: United States (US/USA)
Usable for Transactions: Yes
```

### 2. **Card Generator**
The Card Generator feature allows you to generate credit card numbers based on a given BIN. Generated cards include a valid card number (passing the Luhn algorithm), a random expiration date, and a CVV code.

#### Key Features:
- **Custom BIN Input**: Enter any BIN (e.g., `424182`) to generate cards starting with that BIN.
- **Luhn Algorithm**: Generated card numbers are valid according to the Luhn checksum algorithm.
- **Expiration Date**: Randomly generates a future expiration date (month and year) within the next 5 years.
- **CVV**: Generates a 3-digit CVV code.
- **Save Results**: Option to save generated cards to a text file.

#### How It Works:
- Input a BIN and the number of cards to generate.
- The tool generates cards in the format `cardnumber|month|year|cvv`.
- You can save the results to a file for later use.

#### Example Output:
```
Generated Cards:
4241821234567890|03|2027|123
4241829876543210|11|2028|456
```

### 3. **Card Checker**
The Card Checker feature validates credit card details and determines if a card is "Live" or "Dead" based on several criteria. This is useful for testing generated cards or checking existing ones.

#### Validation Criteria:
- **Luhn Algorithm**: Verifies the card number using the Luhn checksum.
- **Length Check**: Ensures the card number is 16 digits (customizable for other lengths if needed).
- **Expiration Date**: Checks if the card is not expired (must be valid as of the current date, April 2025).
- **CVV Length**: Ensures the CVV is 3 or 4 digits (4 for American Express, 3 for others).
- **Custom Heuristic**: Uses a hash-based method to simulate a "Live" or "Dead" status (30% chance of being "Dead").

#### How It Works:
- Input cards manually or load them from a text file (format: `cardnumber|month|year|cvv`).
- The tool checks each card against the validation criteria.
- Cards passing all checks are marked as "Live" or "Dead" based on the heuristic.
- Results can be saved to a text file.

#### Example Output:
```
Checking Cards...
Live: 4241821234567890|03|2027|123
Dead: 4241829876543210|11|2024|456

Live Cards:
1. 4241821234567890|03|2027|123

Dead Cards:
1. 4241829876543210|11|2024|456

1 cards found live out of 2
```

### 4. **Colorful Terminal UI**
The tool features a vibrant terminal interface with color-coded output for better readability:
- **Red**: Used for errors, "Dead" cards, and invalid BINs.
- **Green**: Used for "Live" cards, valid BINs, and successful operations.
- **Yellow**: Used for prompts and informational messages.
- **Cyan**: Used for menu options and secondary information.
- **Blue**: Used for headers and progress messages.

The UI is enhanced with ASCII art titles for each section, making the tool visually appealing.

### 5. **File I/O Support**
- **Load from Files**: Load BINs or cards from text files (one entry per line).
- **Save Results**: Save BIN lookup results, generated cards, or card checker results to text files using a file dialog.

### 6. **Performance Optimization**
- The tool uses `pickle` to serialize the BIN database into a `.pkl` file (`bin_data.pkl`) after the first run, significantly speeding up subsequent loads compared to re-parsing the CSV file.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `colorama`: For Windows CMD color support.
  - Install it using:
    ```bash
    pip install colorama
    ```

### Running the Script
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carding-tool.git
   cd carding-tool
   ```
2. Place the `bin-list-data.csv` file in the same directory as `carding_tool.py`. This file should contain the BIN database with columns: `BIN`, `Brand`, `Type`, `Category`, `Issuer`, `IssuerPhone`, `IssuerUrl`, `isoCode2`, `isoCode3`, `CountryName`.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python carding_tool.py
   ```
   - The first run will load data from `bin-list-data.csv` and create `bin_data.pkl` for faster loading in future runs.

### Creating a Standalone EXE
To create a standalone EXE file that includes the script and its dependencies:
1. Install `PyInstaller`:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Run the script once to generate `bin_data.pkl`:
   ```bash
   python carding_tool.py
   ```
3. Convert the script to an EXE:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "bin-list-data.csv;." --add-data "bin_data.pkl;." carding_tool.py
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "bin-list-data.csv:." --add-data "bin_data.pkl:." carding_tool.py
     ```
4. Find the EXE in the `dist` folder (`dist/carding_tool.exe`) and run it.
